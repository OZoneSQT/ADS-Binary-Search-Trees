I can't run my test on your code since you let your public operations return
BinaryTreeNodes objects rather than elements object (of the appropriate type <E>).

The user of your api should not bother with extracting the element from treeNodes
(and should not even know about tree nodes).


Look at your insert or remove operation: here you correctly take an element of
any type - you do not require the user to pack it into
a binaryTreeNode object.


Please rehandin the project with the right return types so I can run the tests.
